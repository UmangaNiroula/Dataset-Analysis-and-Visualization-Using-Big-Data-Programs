# Predicting Flight Delays using PySpark and Machine Leaning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict flight delays using PySpark, focusing on efficient data processing and model evaluation. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains flight details such as carrier, origin, distance, and departure time. We use a Logistic Regression model within a pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and cross-validation for tuning hyperparameters. The model's performance is assessed using precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC metrics, offering insights into improving predictions of whether a flight will be delayed. This project highlights the power of PySpark in handling large-scale datasets and building scalable predictive models.
